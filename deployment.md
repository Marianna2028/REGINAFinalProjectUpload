Steps: (followed Canvas videos)

Created Files
Defined Routes
Stated File Routes
Created Modules
Added CSS elements
Attempted to run program through Vercel
Issues/Solutions: When I added the additional html and javascript files the code would not run in the browser. As my solution, I had to specify the correct file path so the code would run.

Also, when I orginally ran the code, I had trouble with the html file file displaying in the router, so in the api.js file under the section "//using the imported routes" I changed the res.send file parameter to be __dirname to run the absolute path of the module in the browser.

I unfortunately encountered isseus with Vercel that I could not resolve. However, I did attempted to make an additonal json file defining the file routes. I also tried to upload the files into a public repository onto Vercel. The last thing I tried was to remove local host from the links. Unfortunately, none of these solutions were able to get the files to run through Vercel. However, it does run on my local server.
